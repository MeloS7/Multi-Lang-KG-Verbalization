We evaluate our three methods on two test sets:
- OOD-472: we create a new test set of 472 KG/Text pairs where each graph was extracted from WikiData and aligned with its verbalisation
into 5 of the  9 target languages we could get native speakers for namely, English, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese.
- WebNLG: e collect all \wg\ test sets that are currently available. This includes the test sets from the \wg\ 2020 shared task (English, Russian);  from the 2023 \wg\ shared task (Breton, Welsh, Irish and Maltese) and a recently published test set for Spanish~\citep{ramon2025spanish}~\footnote{\url{https://zenodo.org/records/15064345}}. These test sets share the same  1,779 KGs (1,102 for Russian). The texts are human-written by crowdworkers, researchers working on the topic (Spanish) or by professional translators.
