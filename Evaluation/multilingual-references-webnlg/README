We evaluate our three methods on WebNLG test data. This includes the test sets from the WebNLG 2020 shared task (English, Russian); from the 2023 WebNLG shared task
(Breton, Welsh, Irish and Maltese) and a recently published test set for [Spanish](https://zenodo.org/records/15064345). 

These test sets share the same 1,779 KGs (1,102 for Russian). The texts are human-written by crowdworkers (English, Maltese, Welsh, Irish), researchers working on the
topic (Russian, Spanish) or by professional translators (Breton).
