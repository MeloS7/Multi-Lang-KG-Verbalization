# Evaluation Page

In this folder, we provide the seq-to-seq evaluation code for the final multilingual output judgement and also the outputs generated by each method in our paper.

- eval_s2s.py: Please check the config file (config_trans_eval.yaml) before the use. This file supports seq-to-seq evaluation with the reference-based metrics such as NMT_Score, SBERT, COMETKiwi, SacreBLEU, TER, ChrF++ and BLEURT for supporting different languages.
- multilingual-references-webnlg: You can find the English reference of WebNLG and their translated versions.
- outputs: Here you can find the outputs generated by all our methods on both WebNLG and GOLD-OOD-472.
