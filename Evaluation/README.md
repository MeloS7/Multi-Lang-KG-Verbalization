# Evaluation Page

In this folder, we provide the evaluation code for the  outputs generated by each method in our paper.

- eval_s2s.py: Please check the config file (config_trans_eval.yaml) before the use. This file supports pairwise sentence evaluation with the reference-based metrics such as NMT_Score, SBERT, COMETKiwi, SacreBLEU, TER, ChrF++ and BLEURT for supporting different languages. Please note that for the NMT_score, please create an individual python environment following (their instructions)[https://github.com/ZurichNLP/nmtscore].
- multilingual-references-webnlg: You can find the gold reference of WebNLG 2020 test graphs for all languages and their translated versions.
- outputs: Here you can find the outputs generated by all our methods on both the WebNLG and the 5L-GOLD-OOD testsets.
